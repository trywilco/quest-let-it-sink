  - Adding a new field to the Frontend
  - Implementing a design for a new feature
hints:
  - Try to create a new item for a seller that is verified. You should see a **verified** icon (does it match the image posted?)
  - Try to create a new item for a seller that is **not verified** (you should not see an icon).
